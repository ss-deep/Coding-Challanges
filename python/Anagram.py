'''Given a word w and a text t, Find all starting indices in t which are anagrams of w.
Example 1:
Input w = ab
t = abxaba
Output [0, 3, 4]
Example 2:
Input w = fab
 t = fabbafafb
Output [0, 3, 6]
[INFO] “ Two strings are said to be anagram if they have the exact same characters in different or same sequence.
Example:
s1 = “ab” s2 = “ba”
Frequency of alphabets in s1: a = 1, b = 1 Frequency of alphabets in s2: a = 1, b = 1
Since frequency of every alphabet is same in both the strings, s1 and s2 are anagrams'''
